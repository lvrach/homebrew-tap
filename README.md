# Homebrew Tap

Welcome to lvrach's personal Homebrew tap repository! This tap contains formulae for installing custom software packages using the Homebrew package manager.

## What is a Homebrew Tap?

A Homebrew tap is a repository of formulae, or package definitions, for the Homebrew package manager. This tap allows you to install software that isn't included in the main Homebrew repository.

## How to Use This Tap

To use this tap, you need to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed on your macOS or Linux system. Once you have Homebrew set up, follow these steps:

Add this tap to your Homebrew installation:

   ```
   brew tap lvrach/homebrew-tap
   ```

2. Install packages from this tap:

   ```
   brew install lvrach/tap/package-name
   ```

   Replace `package-name` with the name of the formula you want to install.
